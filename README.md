## Setup

To generate a new version of `url.js` and copy `liveview2.html` and `liveview3.html` from
`liveview.html`, run `make build`. To just update `liveview2.html` and `liveview3.html`, run `make`.

Fixing https://github.com/jsdom/whatwg-url/issues/61 can help make uri-validate.html functional
again and provide more detailed feedback in liveview too.
